General Update Pattern


    1. create a reference to whatever element youre wanting to sync with d3
    2. in useEffect, select that current reference.
    3. the 3 most important things to know are (enter,update,exit) you access these through the join API


Line Charts --

    1. import {line}
    2. can be built using the path element,
    3. selectAll with 'path' give an attr of 'd', and value => myLine
    4. use scaleLinear for x and y axis ticks scaleLinear you don't have to be explicit on how to map
Scale --
    1. Scale works by taking a domain and essentially scaling that data intp the range

xAxis --
    1. pass your scale functon into axisBottom
    2. make sure to transform each to the correct position


 Bar Charts --

    1.instead of scaleLinear for ticks you use scaleBand with scaleBand you HAVE to be explicit on how to map values
    2.
